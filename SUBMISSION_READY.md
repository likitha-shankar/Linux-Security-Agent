## ⚠️ Important Notes for Submission

### Be Honest About:
1. **False Positive Rate**: Higher than ideal (documented in HONEST_COMPREHENSIVE_ASSESSMENT.md)
2. **Research Prototype**: Not production-ready (clearly marked)
3. **Training Data**: Real ADFA-LD dataset (5,205 samples)
4. **Attack Detection**: Works (all 6 types verified)

### Emphasize:
1. **Real eBPF monitoring** at kernel level
2. **ML models** trained on real dataset
3. **Attack detection** works
4. **Complete working system**
5. **Honest assessment** of limitations

## 🎓 For Your Professor

**When asked about false positives:**
> "The agent has a higher false positive rate than ideal for production use (~93% during normal activity). This is documented in HONEST_COMPREHENSIVE_ASSESSMENT.md. However, it successfully detects all attack types tested. The threshold has been adjusted to 80.0 to reduce false positives, and this is a known limitation of the research prototype."

**When asked if it works:**
> "Yes, all core features work. The agent successfully monitors syscalls via eBPF, ML models detect anomalies, and all 6 attack types are detected. It's a functional research prototype demonstrating kernel-level security monitoring and ML-based anomaly detection."

**When asked about training data:**
> "Real ADFA-LD dataset with 5,205 syscall sequences from actual Linux systems. Downloaded from GitHub and converted with 99.97% syscall name mapping success. Fully documented in TRAINING_DATA_SOURCES.md."
